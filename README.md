NLP Project

I'm excited to share my recent project on classifying fake news using LSTM networks! Here's what I learned:

Implementing a Fake news Classifier using LSTM.

Table of Contents

Step 1 – Importing libraries required for Fake news Classifier.

Step 2 – Reading input data.

Step 3 – Creating X and y data.

Step 4 – Cleaning input data.

Step 5 – Encoding input data.

Step 6 – Processing X and y data.

Step 7 – Creating the model.

Step 8 – Training the Fake news Classifier model.

Step 9 – Checking metrics of the model.

Step 10 – Checking the accuracy of the Fake news Classifier model.


Data Preprocessing:
Mastered text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words to clean and prepare the data for model training.

Model Development: 
Built a robust LSTM model with embedding layers to handle textual data, learning how to structure and tune the model to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting using dropout layers.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model's performance using confusion matrix and accuracy score, achieving over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between real and fake news articles.

This project significantly enhanced my skills in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning, providing valuable insights into handling and classifying textual data. Feel free to connect with me to discuss more about AI and NLP projects!
